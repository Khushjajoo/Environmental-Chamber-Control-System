# Environmental Chamber Unit

This project is an embedded control system built using an STC89-based microcontroller to regulate temperature and humidity in a closed environment. It uses two AHT21 sensors via I2C for real-time monitoring and controls four relays to operate a heater, fan, COâ‚‚ system, and dehumidifier. Data is displayed on an 8x8 LED matrix over SPI, while users can adjust the target temperature using push buttons. The system also uses UART for serial communication, making it easy to monitor live conditions and device status. Designed for precision and reliability, this setup demonstrates a complete solution for automated environmental regulation.
